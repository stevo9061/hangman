/**
 * This main function opens a filestream for *text, pToFile should already be open as we have already selected the *.txt file
 * when running the program. Match histories are stored in stats.txt and random words are fetched default from words.txt.
 * Furthermore, various other functionalities are provided. The other code is explained at the individual points in program.
 * @param **pToFile: We transfer the already open filestream to the correspondingly selected text file.
 * @param WordsReadin: This integer shows how many words are fetched from the text file.
 * @param **ptr: This ptr is used to manipulate the starting point from the array. We don't want to start guessing from "0,erratemich", we want to start from the start postion +2.
 * That is the reason why we used the pointer, its easier to handling as with an array.
 * @param input[]: This is a pointer to the start point from the imported array. An example is "0" because our words starts with zero.
 * @param size_t arr_size: We cannot give over a function the size from our array, therefore we use size_t.
 * @param *buffer: The buffer gives me the size of the string with.
